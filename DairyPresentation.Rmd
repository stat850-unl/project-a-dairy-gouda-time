## The Set-Up {data-background=background.jpg data-background-size=cover}
<div class= "black">

Our team has been approached by a business person who happens to love dairy products! They are interested in starting a dairy to live out their childhood dreams, but are not sure where to start. We combed the USDA and FDA data to make recommendations to ensure they get the best dairy possible.

There is a lot to consider! Maybe exploratory analysis can help!

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
library(magick)
library(magrittr)
library(purrr)

list.files("Cow Pics PNG", pattern = '*.png', full.names = TRUE) %>% 
        image_read() %>% 
        image_join() %>% 
        image_animate(fps=2) %>% 
        image_write(cows, "cows.gif") 
```

## Questions to Answer 

- Where is the best place in the United States to run a dairy operation?
- What products are the most profitable?
- What are hazards to look out for during production to avoid recalls?
