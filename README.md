## Data Set

We are using 2 main entities for data.

The first portion is provided by the USDA ERS:
<https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/dairy-data/> Variables in these
datasets (see CSVs below) are mainly numeric, pertaining to production
and sales of dairy products.

The second being the FDA recalls and notices:
<https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts>
Variables included in this data set are dates, and characters detailing
food brand, product description, product type, and recall reason.

See csv files in repository.

## Potential Topics to Explore Using the Data Set

Scenario: We are a team of agricultural scientists who have been
contacted by a business group interested in starting a dairy products
creamery operation. They are looking to learn

We intend to learn: What in the world in happening in 2020 with milk
prices? What location should we processed in? (Investigate which states
are excelling in milk production to have a supply chain) What products
should we make? (Investigate the sales of products over time) What
difficulties could arise or things should we be aware of? (FDA Recalls)

## Stuff to look at

  - map of change in milk prod for each state (US Map) from 1970 to 2014
    -change in milk production from 1970 to 2014 for top 3 states
    -spread of farm price from retail price over time -Reasons for
    recalls of dairy products
